# Bibliothèque WordPress Theme.

>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

Bibliothèque is a theme focused on blogs (in the edge of multipurpose in WordPress). And it's also a theme designed for plain text (in the edge of Gutenberg). And also a theme without photos (in the edge of the images).

I'm sorry. Bibliothèque was just a design I wanted to make real. And I'm working on it.
